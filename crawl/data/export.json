[{"Abstract:":"Embodiments are disclosed that relate to providing an interactive video viewing experience. For example, one disclosed embodiment includes receiving an interactive video program that comprises a first video segment and one or more branch video segments that each corresponds to a branch along a decision path. The method includes pre-buffering a transition portion of a corresponding branch video segment for each possible user input of one or more possible user inputs along the decision path. The method includes sending the first video segment to a display device and, based upon an actual user input, branching from the first video segment to a transition portion of a branch video segment that corresponds to the actual user input.","Application Number:":"13\/275124","Assignee:":"Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, WA, US)","Export Citation:":"Click for automatic bibliography\n                generation","Filing Date:":1318809600000,"International Classes:":"H04N21\/472","Inventors:":"Stone, Brian (London, GB)                \n                            Johnson, Jerry (London, GB)                \n                            White, Matthew (Cambridgeshire, GB)                \n                            Atkins, Joshua Whitney Samuels (London, GB)","Other Classes:":null,"Primary Class:":"725\/61","Publication Date:":1366243200000,"Title:":"INTERACTIVE VIDEO"},{"Abstract:":"This invention relates to a two way video terminal having video screen and a video camera.

The video analysis processor (101) comprises a segmentation processor (109) which divides a picture into a plurality of picture regions. A picture characteristic processor (111) determines picture characteristic, such as a texture level, for one of the regions, and in response a video encoding selector (113) selects a video encoding parameter for that region. The video encoding parameter is fed to the video encoder (103) wherein a video encode processor (I 19) encodes the picture using the video encoding parameter determined by the external analysis by the video analysis processor (101). The encoded picture is fed back to the video analysis processor (101) and the process is iterated until a desired encoding performance is achieved. The apparatus is particularly suitable for H.264 encoding and allows for improved performance from a selection of encoding parameters based on an external analysis.","Application Number:":"10\/547322","Assignee:":null,"Export Citation:":"Click for automatic bibliography\n                generation","Filing Date:":1077667200000,"International Classes:":"G06K9\/36; G06T9\/00; H04K1\/06; H04N7\/26; H04N7\/50; H04N11\/04","Inventors:":"Burazerovic, Dzevdet (Eindhoven, NL)","Other Classes:":"375\/E7.13,                                    375\/E7.134,                                    375\/E7.135,                                    375\/E7.146,                                    375\/E7.161,                                    375\/E7.163,                                    375\/E7.167,                                    375\/E7.182,                                    375\/E7.189,                                    375\/E7.19,                                    375\/E7.194,                                    375\/E7.211,                                    380\/37,                                    375\/240.01","Primary Class:":"382\/239","Publication Date:":1158192000000,"Title:":"Video encoding"},{"Abstract:":"Panoramic video acquisition guidance is automatically provided as feedback during panoramic video capture.

When the video signal is received, the video receiver displays the video pictures of the video signal within a reduced-size window (24; 50) on the display. Then, the size of the reduced-size window is gradually increased, and the video receiver simultaneously detects the format of the video pictures. Once the format of the video pictures has been detected, the size of the window continues to be increased, but taking into account the detected format, thereby finally giving a full-size window (26; 55) that matches the format of the video pictures.","Application Number:":"12\/600659","Assignee:":"Trident Microsystems ( Far East) Ltd. a corporation","Export Citation:":"Click for automatic bibliography\n                generation","Filing Date:":1212710400000,"International Classes:":"H04N5\/44; H04N7\/16","Inventors:":"Jilagam, Pradeep Kumar (Hyderabad, IN)","Other Classes:":"348\/E5.096","Primary Class:":"348\/553","Publication Date:":1279756800000,"Title:":"VIDEO RECEIVER"},{"Abstract:":"A method of decoding encoded video data, the encoded video data being arranged as a plurality of video picture segments, the data of the video picture segments being arranged so that all header data for the segment are transmitted together and all motion vector data for the segment are transmitted together, the header data and motion vector data being separated by markers, the method comprising:  receiving encoded video data; attempting to decode header information of an encoded video segment; when an attempt to decode all of the header information of an encoded video segment is unsuccessful, attempting to decode the motion vectors for the encoded video segment and,  when the motion vectors for the encoded video segment have been successfully decoded, using the motion vectors with any successfully decoded header information.","Application Number:":"EP20020251864","Assignee:":"British, Telecomm (GB)","Export Citation:":"Click for automatic bibliography\n                generation","Filing Date:":1016150400000,"International Classes:":"G06T9\/00; H04N19\/895; (IPC1-7): H04N7\/68","Inventors:":null,"Other Classes:":null,"Primary Class:":null,"Publication Date:":1063756800000,"Title:":"Video processing"},{"Abstract:":"A video apparatus has a digital decoder generating a first digital stream, a video source of a first analogue signal, a video encoder and a first video decoder connectable to the video source for generating a second digital stream based on the first analogue signal.
